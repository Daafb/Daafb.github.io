          Hi! Welcome to my personal website where I give an overview of my (latest) research!
          <br></br>
          I'm a Master's student in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam.
          I recently completed my thesis and am currently exploring extra-curricular studies.
          I'm in the market for <b>PhD positions in planetary astronomy!</b>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
          I did my bachelors at the <a href="https://www.amsterdamuas.com/" target="_blank"> Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS)</a>, 
          where i majored in (physics) education catered towards high school students. The internships were fun, but I enjoyed the theoretical courses the most. 
          After defending my thesis, which was about the perceived safety of gender diverse students in and outside the classroom,
          I was debating between pursuing a masters in educational sciences or astronomy. In the end, I chose astronomy, as it was something I have been interested in since I was a child.
        <br></br>
          I did my (pre-)master at the <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en" target="_blank"> University of Amsterdam (UvA)</a>
          The premasters course consisted of second year bachelor courses, and was the thoughest academic year I've experienced so far.
          This, I expected, since testimonials I had seen online warned me beforehand. 
          The bachelor encompassed barily more high school level physics and no maths!
          I prepared by taking a minor in interdisciplinary education, specializing  in mathematics. 
          Eventhough this helped, it was not nearly enough! 
          The pre-master track covered second year university level courses in physics, such as 'Quantum Mechanics 2' and Electrodynamics.
          These courses have a reputation as some of the hardest courses in the bachelor at the UvA, and I had to take them without any prior experience in vectorcalculus.
          <br></br>
          I successfully completed the track within the academic year and subsequently pursued a Master’s degree at the <a href="https://api.uva.nl/" target="_blank">Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy (API)</a>.
          It was during this time that I discovered and developed a strong passion for scientific research, particularly within the field of exoplanetary science.
          I recently successfully defended my thesis, which I describe in more detail <a href="#research">here</a>. 
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Currently, I am exploring extra-curricular activities. I am working with <a href="https://staff.science.uva.nl/c.dominik/" target="_blank"> Professor Dominik</a> on a research project. Which is about Mie-theory and proto-planetary discs.
          In addition, I'm taking multiple philosophy of science courses offered by the UvA

        <h3>Thesis</h3>
        <p>
          My thesis focused on <strong>Gaia Astrometric Exoplanet Candidates (ASOIs)</strong> and was supervised by 
          <a href="https://gummiks.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. G.K. Stefansson</a>.
          As part of the third Gaia Data Release (DR3), 72 exoplanet candidates were identified by the Gaia spacecraft.
          Spectroscopic follow-up observations (radial velocity, RV) are essential to distinguish between genuine exoplanets and common false positives, particularly spectroscopic binaries.
          <br><br>
          In this project, I analyzed Gaia DR3 data to identify potential exoplanet candidates beyond the published ASOIs.
          I also examined the current ASOI list using spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to investigate possible signs of stellar multiplicity.
          The work contributed to three telescope proposals for state-of-the-art spectroscopic instruments, and three peer-reviewed publications on which I am listed as a co-author.
          <br><br>
          This thesis marked my <strong>first hands-on research experience in astronomy and confirmed my enthusiasm for pursuing a research career in the field</strong>.
